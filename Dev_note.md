12:16, 05/10, 2025
Perfect! ✅ I've successfully added Google OAuth authentication to your app:
  What was added:
  - ✅ "Continue with Google" button on both login and signup pages
  - ✅ Google OAuth flow using Supabase authentication
  - ✅ OAuth callback handler at /auth/callback to complete the sign-in
  - ✅ Visual divider ("Or continue with email") between OAuth and email/password
  - ✅ Google logo in the button for better UX
  - ✅ Loading states for both Google and email sign-in methods

  Next steps to enable Google OAuth:
  1. Go to your https://supabase.com/dashboard
  2. Navigate to Authentication → Providers
  3. Enable Google provider
  4. Add your Google OAuth credentials (Client ID & Secret)
  5. Set the redirect URL to: https://receiptsort.vercel.app/auth/callback

13:09, 05/10, 2025
🔍 Debugging Reflection: Google OAuth Issues
  Root Causes Identified:
  1. Supabase Site URL misconfiguration ⭐ (Main issue)
    - Supabase's "Site URL" was set to http://localhost:3000
    - This overrides all OAuth redirect logic
    - Fix: Changed to https://receiptsort.vercel.app in Supabase settings
  2. Database trigger incompatibility with OAuth users
    - Original trigger used new.email which works for email/password signup
    - OAuth users store email in raw_user_meta_data->>'email'
    - Fix: Enhanced trigger to extract email from multiple sources using COALESCE()
  3. OAuth redirect URL in code
    - Code used window.location.origin which is localhost during local dev
    - Fix: Use NEXT_PUBLIC_URL env variable (set in Vercel)

  Lessons Learned:
  - Infrastructure > Code: The Site URL configuration in Supabase was the blocker, not the code
  - OAuth metadata differs: Email/password vs OAuth providers structure user data differently
  - Error handling matters: Added ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE and exception handling to prevent signup failures

14:16, 05/10, 2025
✅ Day 2.2 Complete! Receipt list view with real-time updates has been implemented and committed.
  What was built:

  - ✅ Search & filter - by filename, merchant, and status
  - ✅ Actions dropdown - View, Process, Edit, Delete
  - ✅ Empty state - "No receipts yet" with upload CTA
  - ✅ Loading skeleton - Better UX while fetching
  - ✅ Image thumbnails - Shows preview for images, icon for PDFs
  - ✅ Responsive design - Table on desktop, cards on mobile
  Routes created:
  - /dashboard/receipts - View all receipts page

14:20, 05/10, 2025
Task 2.3 complete. The ReceiptDetailModal is now fully integrated with ReceiptList - clicking "View Details" on any receipt (desktop or mobile) will open the modal with the receipt preview and editable form.

14:35, 05/10, 2025
Task 2.4 complete!
  Summary:
  ✅ Created API endpoint at app/api/receipts/[id]/view/route.ts:
  - Verifies user authentication
  - Confirms user owns the receipt
  - Generates signed URL valid for 5 minutes
  - Returns URL with expiration timestamp
  ✅ Updated ReceiptDetailModal:
  - Fetches signed URL when modal opens
  - Displays loading/error states
  - Auto-refreshes URL at 4.5 minutes (before expiration)
  - Uses signed URLs for both image and PDF previews
  - Includes retry button on errors
  ✅ Security implemented:
  - User ownership verification in API endpoint
  - Private storage bucket (removed public URLs from ReceiptList)
  - 5-minute URL expiration
  - 403 Forbidden if user tries to access another user's receipt
  The storage bucket is now fully private - all file access goes through signed URLs with proper authentication and authorization checks.

15:41, 05/10, 2025
Perfect! ✅ All navigation issues fixed and deployed!

  What was broken:
  The sidebar was linking to /dashboard/upload, /dashboard/receipts, and /dashboard/export, but the actual files are in the (dashboard) route group which doesn't add /dashboard to the URL path.

  What I fixed:
  1. ✅ Updated Sidebar navigation - Changed all routes from /dashboard/* to /*
  2. ✅ Fixed internal links - Updated links in dashboard page and receipt list
  3. ✅ Created missing pages:
    - /export - Export page with CSV/Excel/PDF options (placeholder UI)
    - /credits - Credits page with current balance and pricing tiers
  4. ✅ Pushed to production - Changes deployed to Vercel
  Working routes:
  - /dashboard - Main dashboard ✓
  - /upload - Upload receipts ✓
  - /receipts - View all receipts ✓
  - /export - Export data ✓
  - /credits - Manage credits ✓

15:43, 05/10, 2025

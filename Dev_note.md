Done! I've created all authentication pages with Supabase Auth for your Next.js 14 App Router:

  Created files:
  - âœ… app/(auth)/layout.tsx - Centered auth layout with ReceiptSort branding, redirects logged-in users
  - âœ… app/(auth)/login/page.tsx - Login page
  - âœ… app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx - Signup page

  Features:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Form validation with Zod
  - Password confirmation on signup
  - Toast notifications for all errors and success states
  - Graceful Supabase error handling (invalid credentials, email confirmation, duplicate accounts)
  - Links between login/signup pages
  - Automatic redirect to /dashboard on success
  - Shadcn/ui components (Card, Form, Input, Button)

  The authentication flow is ready to use at /login and /signup!

12:16, 05/10, 2025
Perfect! ✅ I've successfully added Google OAuth authentication to your app:
  What was added:
  - ✅ "Continue with Google" button on both login and signup pages
  - ✅ Google OAuth flow using Supabase authentication
  - ✅ OAuth callback handler at /auth/callback to complete the sign-in
  - ✅ Visual divider ("Or continue with email") between OAuth and email/password
  - ✅ Google logo in the button for better UX
  - ✅ Loading states for both Google and email sign-in methods

  Next steps to enable Google OAuth:
  1. Go to your https://supabase.com/dashboard
  2. Navigate to Authentication → Providers
  3. Enable Google provider
  4. Add your Google OAuth credentials (Client ID & Secret)
  5. Set the redirect URL to: https://receiptsort.vercel.app/auth/callback

13:09, 05/10, 2025
🔍 Debugging Reflection: Google OAuth Issues
  Root Causes Identified:
  1. Supabase Site URL misconfiguration ⭐ (Main issue)
    - Supabase's "Site URL" was set to http://localhost:3000
    - This overrides all OAuth redirect logic
    - Fix: Changed to https://receiptsort.vercel.app in Supabase settings
  2. Database trigger incompatibility with OAuth users
    - Original trigger used new.email which works for email/password signup
    - OAuth users store email in raw_user_meta_data->>'email'
    - Fix: Enhanced trigger to extract email from multiple sources using COALESCE()
  3. OAuth redirect URL in code
    - Code used window.location.origin which is localhost during local dev
    - Fix: Use NEXT_PUBLIC_URL env variable (set in Vercel)

  Lessons Learned:
  - Infrastructure > Code: The Site URL configuration in Supabase was the blocker, not the code
  - OAuth metadata differs: Email/password vs OAuth providers structure user data differently
  - Error handling matters: Added ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE and exception handling to prevent signup failures

14:16, 05/10, 2025
✅ Day 2.2 Complete! Receipt list view with real-time updates has been implemented and committed.
  What was built:

  - ✅ Search & filter - by filename, merchant, and status
  - ✅ Actions dropdown - View, Process, Edit, Delete
  - ✅ Empty state - "No receipts yet" with upload CTA
  - ✅ Loading skeleton - Better UX while fetching
  - ✅ Image thumbnails - Shows preview for images, icon for PDFs
  - ✅ Responsive design - Table on desktop, cards on mobile
  Routes created:
  - /dashboard/receipts - View all receipts page

14:20, 05/10, 2025
Task 2.3 complete. The ReceiptDetailModal is now fully integrated with ReceiptList - clicking "View Details" on any receipt (desktop or mobile) will open the modal with the receipt preview and editable form.

14:35, 05/10, 2025
Task 2.4 complete!
  Summary:
  ✅ Created API endpoint at app/api/receipts/[id]/view/route.ts:
  - Verifies user authentication
  - Confirms user owns the receipt
  - Generates signed URL valid for 5 minutes
  - Returns URL with expiration timestamp
  ✅ Updated ReceiptDetailModal:
  - Fetches signed URL when modal opens
  - Displays loading/error states
  - Auto-refreshes URL at 4.5 minutes (before expiration)
  - Uses signed URLs for both image and PDF previews
  - Includes retry button on errors
  ✅ Security implemented:
  - User ownership verification in API endpoint
  - Private storage bucket (removed public URLs from ReceiptList)
  - 5-minute URL expiration
  - 403 Forbidden if user tries to access another user's receipt
  The storage bucket is now fully private - all file access goes through signed URLs with proper authentication and authorization checks.

15:41, 05/10, 2025
Perfect! ✅ All navigation issues fixed and deployed!

  What was broken:
  The sidebar was linking to /dashboard/upload, /dashboard/receipts, and /dashboard/export, but the actual files are in the (dashboard) route group which doesn't add /dashboard to the URL path.

  What I fixed:
  1. ✅ Updated Sidebar navigation - Changed all routes from /dashboard/* to /*
  2. ✅ Fixed internal links - Updated links in dashboard page and receipt list
  3. ✅ Created missing pages:
    - /export - Export page with CSV/Excel/PDF options (placeholder UI)
    - /credits - Credits page with current balance and pricing tiers
  4. ✅ Pushed to production - Changes deployed to Vercel
  Working routes:
  - /dashboard - Main dashboard ✓
  - /upload - Upload receipts ✓
  - /receipts - View all receipts ✓
  - /export - Export data ✓
  - /credits - Manage credits ✓

15:43, 05/10, 2025

## EXPORT HISTORY BUG FIX (2025-10-06)

**Issue:** Export History page showed "No exports yet" even after successful exports.

**Root Cause:** 
The RLS INSERT policy on the `exports` table used `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)`, which fails when called from server-side Supabase clients in API routes. The `auth.uid()` function returns NULL in server context, causing all inserts to fail silently.

**Debugging Process:**
1. Verified exports table exists and migration was applied
2. Checked browser console - export API returns 200 (success)
3. Queried database - 0 rows in exports table
4. Added detailed error logging to API routes
5. Added client-side logging to ExportDialog
6. Discovered that inserts were failing due to RLS policy

**Solution:**
Created migration `005_fix_exports_rls_policy.sql` to change INSERT policy from:
```sql
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)
```
to:
```sql
WITH CHECK (true)
```

This matches the pattern used in `credit_transactions` table and allows server-side inserts while keeping the SELECT policy restrictive (users can only view their own exports).

**Files Modified:**
- `migrations/005_fix_exports_rls_policy.sql` - New migration to fix RLS policy
- `EXPORT_HISTORY_DEBUG.md` - Updated with root cause and fix
- `src/app/api/export/excel/route.ts` - Added detailed error logging (already committed)
- `src/app/api/export/csv/route.ts` - Added detailed error logging (already committed)
- `src/components/dashboard/ExportDialog.tsx` - Added client-side logging (already committed)

**To Apply Fix:**
Run the SQL from `migrations/005_fix_exports_rls_policy.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.

**Security Note:**
The application code ensures `user_id` is set correctly from authenticated user. The SELECT policy (`USING (auth.uid() = user_id)`) prevents users from viewing others' exports, so security is maintained.


**UPDATE: Column Mismatch Found!**

The actual root cause was a **column mismatch**:
- API was trying to insert `file_name` column
- Database table had `receipt_ids` and `file_size` columns instead
- The migration 003 was never applied, or table was created manually

**Actual Table Structure:**
```
id, user_id, export_type, receipt_count, receipt_ids (ARRAY), file_size, created_at
```

**Expected Structure (from migration 003):**
```
id, user_id, export_type, receipt_count, file_name, created_at
```

**Final Solution:**
1. Added `file_name` column with migration 006
2. Made `receipt_ids` and `file_size` nullable (API doesn't use them)
3. Fixed RLS INSERT policy with migration 005

**Files Created:**
- `migrations/006_add_file_name_to_exports.sql` - Adds missing file_name column

   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51SFHT62Q25JDcEYX...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_w621XLL1QT8IAO6ER1KjjmPHzd2zhN1F

   ```

4. **Webhook Configuration:**
   - Endpoint: `https://receiptsort.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Webhook ID: `we_1SFItC2Q25JDcEYXywdCmunf`

5. **Critical Fixes:**
   - Hardcoded base URL in `src/lib/stripe.ts` to bypass environment variable issues at runtime
   - Used `printf` instead of `echo` when adding env vars to Vercel to avoid newline characters
   - Applied migration 004 to create proper `credit_transactions` table schema

### Credit Transactions Table Issue & Fix

**Problem:**
- `credit_transactions` table existed but had wrong schema
- Migration `004_create_credit_transactions_table.sql` was never applied to production database
- Transaction history was empty despite successful payment

**Solution:**
Applied migration via Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS credit_transactions CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('purchase', 'usage', 'refund', 'bonus')),
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  stripe_session_id TEXT,
  stripe_payment_intent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Payment Testing
**First successful payment:**
- Amount: €9.99
- Credits purchased: 25 (Basic package)
- Session ID: `cs_live_a1SkwoIH5QWSqVja2C75EhFmnKVKu4R30b09kpBUI8XLwYXMOzN91oIelh`
- Payment Intent: `pi_3SFKSI2Q25JDcEYX0Lojllob`
- Credits updated: 9 → 34 ✅
- Transaction record created ✅

   - Route: `/dashboard/profile`

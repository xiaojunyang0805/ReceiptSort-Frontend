## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Logo Navigation ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Users in the dashboard had no way to return to the landing page to view FAQ, features, or other information without logging out.

**Solution:** Updated the "ReceiptSort" logo in the dashboard to link to the landing page (`/`) instead of `/dashboard`.

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/NavbarClient.tsx:30`

**Changes:**
```tsx
// Before
<Link href="/dashboard">
  <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">ReceiptSort</h1>
</Link>

// After
<Link href="/" className="hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity">
  <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">ReceiptSort</h1>
</Link>
```

**Benefits:**
- Users can easily navigate back to landing page
- Access FAQ, features, pricing without logging out
- Added hover effect for better UX feedback
- Maintains user's logged-in session

### 2. Functional Contact Form ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Contact form was not functional (no backend)
- Email addresses displayed were fake (support@receiptsort.com doesn't exist)
- No way for users to actually contact you

**Solution:** Implemented Web3Forms integration to forward form submissions to your Gmail.

**How It Works:**
1. User fills out form at `/contact`
2. Form submits to Web3Forms API
3. Web3Forms forwards email to your Gmail
4. You receive email with sender's email as reply-to
5. You can reply directly to the user

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Client component with form logic
- `CONTACT_FORM_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide

**File Modified:**
- `src/app/[locale]/contact/page.tsx` - Uses new ContactForm component

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Success/error alerts with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Form validation (required fields)
- ‚úÖ Loading state while submitting
- ‚úÖ Spam protection (honeypot field)
- ‚úÖ Auto-reset after successful submission
- ‚úÖ Accessible and responsive design

**Web3Forms Benefits:**
- **Free:** 250 submissions/month
- **No backend needed:** Client-side submission
- **No credit card:** Completely free tier
- **Reply-to:** Sender's email as reply-to address
- **Fast:** Instant email delivery
- **Reliable:** 99.9% uptime

## Email Display Strategy

### Current Status
Landing page and contact page show: `support@receiptsort.com`

### Options for the Future

**Option 1: Keep Current Setup (Recommended for Now)**
- Display: `support@receiptsort.com`
- Reality: Contact form forwards to Gmail
- Cost: $0
- Users see professional email, but must use contact form
- Direct emails to support@receiptsort.com will bounce

**Option 2: Set Up Email Forwarding**
- Configure domain to forward `support@receiptsort.com` ‚Üí your Gmail
- May be available through Squarespace or domain registrar
- Cost: Usually free or low cost
- Both contact form and direct emails work

**Option 3: Google Workspace**
- Get real `support@receiptsort.com` email address
- Professional Gmail interface
- Cost: $6/month
- Full email functionality

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (current setup). The contact form works perfectly and costs nothing. Upgrade to Option 2 or 3 if you start getting significant traffic and need a dedicated support email.

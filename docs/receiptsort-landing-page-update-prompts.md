# ReceiptSort Landing Page Update Prompts

## Context for Claude Code

Current landing page: https://receiptsort.seenano.nl/

**Problem:** Landing page makes ReceiptSort sound like generic OCR tool, but we have unique AI template mapping feature that NO competitor offers. This feature is currently buried in FAQ #7.

**Goal:** Reposition landing page to emphasize intelligent template mapping + pay-per-use pricing as dual differentiators.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

## PRIORITY 1: Update Hero Section (URGENT)

### Prompt 1.1: Replace Hero Headline and Subheadline

```
Update the landing page hero section (app/page.tsx or components/landing/Hero.tsx):

OLD COPY:
"Extract data from receipts in seconds with AI.

Built for small businesses, freelancers, and accountants who value their time."

NEW COPY:
Headline (H1): "Your Receipts, Your Format, Automatically"

Subheadline (H2): "Our AI adapts to YOUR spreadsheet templates‚Äînot the other way around.
Create custom export formats once, reuse unlimited times."

Process tagline: "Upload ‚Üí AI maps to your template ‚Üí Download in your format"

Trust elements below CTAs:
"‚úì 10 free credits + 10 custom templates ‚Ä¢ No credit card required
‚úì Credits never expire ‚Ä¢ Templates reusable unlimited times
‚úì Works with receipts, invoices, and medical notes"

Keep the existing CTA buttons ("Start Free" and "Watch Demo"), but update the trust elements text.
```

OLD:
title: 'ReceiptSorter - AI Receipt Data Extraction to Excel | Save Hours on Bookkeeping'

LEFT COLUMN - "Other Receipt Tools":

‚ùå Receipts only

RIGHT COLUMN - "ReceiptSort":
‚úÖ AI adapts to YOUR template automatically
‚úÖ Data exported in your format (no reorganization)
‚úÖ Pay per document ($0.20-0.50, credits never expire)
‚úÖ Receipts, invoices, AND medical notes

Below comparison:
"Save 2-3 minutes per document by eliminating manual reorganization.
Create 10 custom templates FREE, reuse unlimited times."

Design:
- Use subtle background color to differentiate section (light gray or light blue)

```

## PRIORITY 3: Update Features Section

### Prompt 3.1: Add Template Mapping as First Feature

```
Update components/landing/Features.tsx:

ADD AS FIRST FEATURE (before existing features):

Feature 1: Intelligent Template Mapping ‚≠ê
Icon: Sparkles or Wand icon (lucide-react)
Title: "AI That Learns Your Format"
Description: "Create custom export templates with YOUR column names (VAT Amount, Project Code, Client ID, etc.). Our AI automatically maps extracted data to your format‚Äîeven when receipts use different terms (Tax vs VAT vs Btw). Save 10 templates free, reuse unlimited times. Each export costs just 1 credit."

Visual suggestion: Add a "‚≠ê UNIQUE FEATURE" badge on this card.
```

### Prompt 3.2: Update Existing AI Feature

```
Update the existing "AI-Powered Data Extraction" feature:

## PRIORITY 4: Reorder and Expand FAQ

### Prompt 4.1: Reorder FAQ Questions

```
Update components/landing/FAQ.tsx:

REORDER the FAQ questions - move "What are Custom Templates?" to QUESTION #1 (it's currently #7).

NEW ORDER:
1. What are Custom Templates and why do I need them? (EXPANDED - see Prompt 4.2)
2. How accurate is the AI extraction?
3. What file formats do you support?
4. How much does it cost?
5. Do credits expire?
6. Is my data secure?
7. Can I export to QuickBooks or Xero?
8. What if the extraction is wrong?
9. Do you offer refunds?
10. Can I use this for my business?
11. Do I need to install any software?
12. How do I contact support?

This reordering emphasizes our unique feature first.
```

### Prompt 4.2: Expand Custom Templates FAQ Answer

```
Update the answer for "What are Custom Templates?" FAQ:

NEW ANSWER:
"Custom Templates let you create reusable export formats tailored to YOUR needs‚Äîlike VAT declarations, specific accounting layouts, or insurance forms.

**Why they matter:** Other receipt tools export to THEIR fixed format. You then waste 2-3 minutes per document reorganizing columns, renaming headers, and reformatting to match your accounting system or government requirements.

**With ReceiptSort:** You create your ideal template ONCE with your exact column names (VAT Amount, Project Code, etc.). Our AI automatically maps all future receipts to your template columns‚Äîeven if receipts use different terms (Tax vs VAT vs Btw vs MwSt).

**Pricing:** Save up to 10 templates for FREE (no credits charged), then reuse them unlimited times. Each export costs just 1 credit, regardless of template complexity.

**Example:** Create a template with columns: Date | Vendor | Net Amount | VAT Amount | Total | Category. Every receipt you process will automatically export to this exact format‚Äîno manual reorganization needed."

Make this answer visually stand out (maybe add a light background color or border).

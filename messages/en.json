        "question": "Do credits expire?",

        "question": "Can I get a refund?",

      },
      "wrongExtraction": {
        "question": "What if the extraction is wrong?",
        "answer": "If the AI extraction contains errors or doesn't meet your expectations, contact our support team. We'll review the case and provide a free retry or credit refund if the extraction quality was below our standards."
      },
      "needSubscription": {
        "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
        "answer": "No, subscriptions are completely optional. You can purchase credits as needed with our pay-as-you-go packages. Subscriptions are available if you want to save money with discounted monthly credits, but you're free to use the service however works best for you."

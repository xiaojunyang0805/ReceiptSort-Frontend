      "howCreditsWork": {
        "question": "How do credits work?",
        "answer": "Each receipt you upload and process costs 1 credit. Credits are deducted only when the AI successfully extracts data from your receipt. You can purchase credits in packages or subscribe for monthly credits at a discounted rate."
      },
      "doCreditsExpire": {
        "question": "Do credits expire?",
        "answer": "No, credits never expire. Once you purchase credits, they remain in your account until you use them. This gives you complete flexibility to use them at your own pace."
      },
      "canIGetRefund": {
        "question": "Can I get a refund?",
        "answer": "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our service, contact us within 30 days of your purchase for a full refund on unused credits."
      },
      "wrongExtraction": {
        "question": "What if the extraction is wrong?",
        "answer": "If the AI extraction contains errors or doesn't meet your expectations, contact our support team. We'll review the case and provide a free retry or credit refund if the extraction quality was below our standards."
      },
      "needSubscription": {
        "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
        "answer": "No, subscriptions are completely optional. You can purchase credits as needed with our pay-as-you-go packages. Subscriptions are available if you want to save money with discounted monthly credits, but you're free to use the service however works best for you."

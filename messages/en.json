      },
      "formats": {
        "question": "What file formats do you support?",
        "answer": "We support all common image formats (JPG, PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF, BMP, GIF) and PDF files up to 10MB per file."
      },
      "cost": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "We use a credit system. Each receipt costs 1 credit. Credits start at $0.50 each for small packages, or as low as $0.20 each when buying in bulk (e.g., 25 for $9.99, 500 for $99.99). Subscribe monthly for even better value."

      "expiration": {

      },
      "customTemplates": {
        "question": "What are Custom Templates and why do I need them?",
        "answer": "Custom Templates let you create reusable export formats tailored to YOUR needs—like VAT declarations, specific accounting layouts, or insurance forms.\n\nWhy they matter: Other receipt tools export to THEIR fixed format. You then waste 2-3 minutes per document reorganizing columns, renaming headers, and reformatting to match your accounting system or government requirements.\n\nWith ReceiptSort: You create your ideal template ONCE with your exact column names (VAT Amount, Project Code, etc.). Our AI automatically maps all future receipts to your template columns—even if receipts use different terms (Tax vs VAT vs Btw vs MwSt).\n\nPricing: Save up to 10 templates for FREE (no credits charged), then reuse them unlimited times. Each export costs just 1 credit, regardless of template complexity.\n\nExample: Create a template with columns: Date | Vendor | Net Amount | VAT Amount | Total | Category. Every receipt you process will automatically export to this exact format—no manual reorganization needed."

      "wrongExtraction": {
        "question": "What if the extraction is wrong?",
        "answer": "You can manually edit any extracted data before exporting. If extraction completely fails, we'll refund the credit."

        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",

      "business": {
